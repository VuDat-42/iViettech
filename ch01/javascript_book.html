        To get you off to a fast start, this book shows you how to develop, test, and debug your first JavaScript applications 
        in the first 3 chapters. Then, it builds on those skills to teach you all the JavaScript features youll use in professional 
        applications, the way the top developers do. Next, it shows you how to use DOM scripting for the special effects that add 
        to a websites functionality and appeal. Beyond that, it shows you how to create your own event libraries to store reusable 
        code for responding to user actions code thats critical for browser compatibility in handling DOM events.,
